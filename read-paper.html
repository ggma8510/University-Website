                <h2>The Mission</h2>
                <p>To design and build a functional, single-seater electric car from scratch with a budget of less than $10,000, proving that passion and focused execution can outperform a traditional 4-year engineering degree.</p>

                <h2>The "Anti-Curriculum": A Practical Roadmap</h2>
                <p>Instead of a fixed syllabus, Alex's education was a fluid roadmap based on the immediate problems he needed to solve. His learning was divided into three key blocks:</p>

                <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-12 items-center my-16">
                    <div class="order-2 md:order-1">
                        <h3>Core Technicals (CT): Just-in-Time Learning</h3>
                        <p>Alex learned skills only when he needed them. This wasn't about passing exams; it was about making progress.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc">
                            <li><strong>Welding (Weeks 1-4):</strong> He didn't read a textbook. He bought a cheap welder and spent 100 hours joining scrap metal until his welds were strong.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electronics (Weeks 5-8):</strong> He learned basic circuit theory by wiring a simple motor to a battery, burning out several components in the process. Each failure was a lesson.</li>
                            <li><strong>3D Modeling (Weeks 9-16):</strong> He learned just enough CAD to design a functional chassis, ignoring all advanced features of the software.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="order-1 md:order-2">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Execution Practice (EP): Build, Break, Repeat</h3>
                <p>This was the core of his education. The plan was simple: build a series of increasingly complex prototypes.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prototype 1 (The "Ugly Kart"):</strong> A bare-bones go-kart frame with a small motor. The goal was simple: make it move. It took 3 months and countless failures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prototype 2 (The "Rolling Chassis"):</strong> A more robust frame with functional steering and suspension. This phase was about control and stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prototype 3 (The Final Vehicle):</strong> The full-scale car with a custom-designed body. This final stage integrated all previously learned skills.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Mind Architecture (MA): The Internal Game</h2>
                <p>The biggest challenge was not technical; it was mental. Alex had to learn to manage the crushing frustration of a failed weld or a fried circuit. He kept a "failure log" to document every mistake, turning setbacks into data points. This practice built extreme resilience and a detached, problem-solving mindset.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion: The Outcome</h2>
                <p>In 24 months, Alex had a functional electric car. He didn't have a degree, but he had something far more valuable: proven, real-world capability. He had learned more about engineering, problem-solving, and resilience by building one car than most students learn in four years of theoretical study.</p>
